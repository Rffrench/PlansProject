# PlansProject


This is an HTML/CSS/JS tiny website with just 2 pages that simulates an Antivirus company. Note that this project has some things coded in a way that I would not apply nowadays that I've got more experience and knowledge.

### First Page

Welcome page with some info

### Login Page 

This login was completely created and designed by me. 

Both pages are completely responsive
